Hello! My name is Viacheslav.
I'm 20 years old and I live in Russia, St.-Petersburg.

I'm a web developer with no commercial experience yet.
I actively study new technologies for myself, I have a great desire to start gaining experience in the field of IT.
Currently I specialize in the development of websites and web applications.

I am familiar with the following technologies:

1. PHP 8.0 (I have an understanding of how OOP works)
2. MySQL (I know how to work with a database in PHP, I know SQL queries)
3. HTML5 - Basics
4. CSS3 - Basics
5. Learn to use composer in every project

In the near future, I plan to study the work of various libraries on PHP, as well as learn how to work with the Laravel framework.
After that I want to learn JavaScript and React as I need to learn Ajax requests and also in most vacancy need to know JS.

Currently, I would be very happy to get some kind of internship.
I want to start putting my knowledge into practice as soon as possible, as well as expand my knowledge.
Remuneration does not play a big role for me, because I understand that I am not a specialist.
